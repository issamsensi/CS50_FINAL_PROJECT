SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION (30-45 seconds)
================================================================================

[SHOW: Your face on camera OR project title screen]

"Hello! My name is Issam Sensi, also known as Issam Amghar, and this is my 
final project for CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.

Today, I'm excited to present UNLIMITE SHOOTER - a comprehensive full-stack 
project that combines game development with web development.

This project consists of two main components: a 2D top-down shooter game built 
with Python and Pygame, and a professional promotional website built with Flask. 
Throughout this demo, I'll show you both components and explain the technologies 
I used to bring this project to life.

Let's dive in!"

================================================================================
SECTION 2: WEBSITE DEMONSTRATION (2-3 minutes)
================================================================================

[SWITCH TO: Browser showing the website]

--- HOME PAGE (30 seconds) ---

"First, let me show you the website component. This is the home page of 
UNLIMITE SHOOTER, built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

As you can see, I've designed a modern dark-themed interface with a clean 
navigation bar at the top. The website is fully responsive, meaning it works 
great on both desktop and mobile devices.

[SCROLL DOWN]

The home page features an overview of the game, information about the developer - 
that's me - and social media links for easy contact."

--- ABOUT PAGE (30 seconds) ---

[CLICK: About link]

"The About page provides detailed information about the game, including these 
screenshots showing actual gameplay, the game over screen, and the shop system.

[SCROLL through images]

I've included multiple screenshots so visitors can see what the game looks like 
before downloading it."

--- DEVELOPER PAGE (45 seconds) ---

[CLICK: Developer link]

"The Developer page is my personal portfolio section. Here, I talk about myself, 
my background - I'm from Morocco and recently graduated with a BTS in DSI, which 
is Development of Information Systems.

[SCROLL DOWN]

I've listed all the technologies and programming languages I've worked with, 
including Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Flask, Pygame, and many more.

[SCROLL to carousel]

And here's something special - I've included a carousel of my artwork. I enjoy 
drawing in my free time, and I wanted to showcase some of my work using 
Bootstrap's carousel component."

--- CONTACT PAGE (30 seconds) ---

[CLICK: Contact link]

"The Contact page features a form where visitors can send me messages. When 
someone fills out this form...

[FILL IN: Name, email, message]

...and clicks Send Message, it opens their default email client with all the 
information pre-filled. This uses Flask's form handling and URL encoding.

[SCROLL DOWN]

I've also integrated all my social media platforms - Facebook, Instagram, 
TikTok, LinkedIn, GitHub, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter - using Font Awesome 
icons."

--- NEWSLETTER (20 seconds) ---

[SCROLL to footer]

"At the bottom of every page, there's a newsletter subscription form. This is 
connected to a SQLite database that stores email addresses.

[TYPE: example@email.com and SUBMIT]

When someone subscribes, the email is saved to the database, and the system 
checks for duplicates to prevent multiple subscriptions. You can see the flash 
message confirming the subscription."

--- TECHNICAL OVERVIEW (20 seconds) ---

"From a technical perspective, this website uses:
- Flask for the backend and routing
- Jinja2 for template inheritance - notice how the header and footer are 
  consistent across all pages
- SQLite database for storing newsletter subscriptions
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- Custom CSS with CSS variables for the dark theme
- And Font Awesome for all the icons

Now, let's move on to the main attraction - the game!"

================================================================================
SECTION 3: GAME DEMONSTRATION (2.5-3 minutes)
================================================================================

[SWITCH TO: Game running]

--- GAME START (30 seconds) ---

"This is UNLIMITE SHOOTER, a 2D top-down shooter built entirely with Python 
and Pygame.

[SHOW: Player character on map]

You control this green triangular spaceship using WASD or arrow keys. The 
player always faces the direction you're moving, which is important for shooting.

[MOVE AROUND]

Notice the HUD at the top left showing my health bar, kill count, current wave, 
gold, and crystals. The background is a custom image I've loaded using Pygame."

--- COMBAT DEMONSTRATION (45 seconds) ---

[START SHOOTING with SPACE]

"Combat is the core of the game. I shoot by pressing the spacebar, and bullets 
fire in the direction I'm facing.

[ENEMIES START SPAWNING]

Enemies spawn from all four edges of the screen and use pathfinding AI to chase 
the player. There are three types of enemies:

[POINT OUT each type as they appear]

- Normal enemies in red with balanced stats
- Fast enemies in light red that move quickly but die in one hit
- And tank enemies - these larger, darker enemies are slow but have 5 HP

[KILL SOME ENEMIES]

When I defeat enemies, they explode with particle effects - these are 15 
individual particles with random velocities that fade over time."

--- COLLECTIBLES (30 seconds) ---

[COLLECT items]

"Defeated enemies drop collectibles. Gold coins have a 50% drop rate and are 
used for basic upgrades. Crystals are much rarer at only 5% and are used for 
special abilities.

[SHOW collection animation]

Notice the particle effects when I collect items - the same system I used for 
explosions, but with different colors."

--- SHOP SYSTEM (60 seconds) ---

[WALK to door at top]

"This brown door at the top of the screen leads to the shop. When I walk into it...

[ENTER SHOP]

...the game state changes to the shop screen with a different background.

Here I can spend my gold and crystals on upgrades:
- Increase Max HP for 50 gold
- Boost Speed for 30 gold  
- Enhance Damage for 40 gold
- Improve Fire Rate for 35 gold
- Unlock Multi-Shot for 3 crystals
- Or unlock Laser Bullets for 5 crystals

[PURCHASE an upgrade - e.g., press 2 for speed]

When I purchase an upgrade, the cost is deducted immediately. Let me buy the 
speed upgrade.

[PRESS B to exit]

I press B to return to the game, and my character spawns just outside the door."

--- ADVANCED FEATURES (30 seconds) ---

[If you have crystals, buy multi-shot or laser]

"Let me show you the special bullet types. I'll purchase Multi-Shot with my 
crystals.

[SHOOT with multi-shot]

Now when I shoot, three bullets fire in a spread pattern - perfect for hitting 
multiple enemies!

[CONTINUE PLAYING]

The game gets progressively harder. Every 10 kills, I advance to a new wave, 
and enemies spawn faster. After 20 kills, fast enemies start appearing, and 
after 50 kills, tank enemies join the mix."

--- GAME OVER (20 seconds) ---

[LET PLAYER DIE or show game over screen]

"When the player's health reaches zero, the game over screen displays final 
statistics: total kills, highest wave reached, gold collected, and crystals 
found.

From here, I can press R to restart or Q to quit."

================================================================================
SECTION 4: TECHNICAL EXPLANATION (60-90 seconds)
================================================================================

[SWITCH TO: Code editor OR back to camera]

"Now let me explain the technical implementation.

For the GAME component, I wrote over 600 lines of Python code organized into 
six classes:
- The Game class manages game states and the main loop
- The Player class handles movement, shooting, and upgrades
- The Enemy class with three variants using inheritance
- The Bullet class with trigonometry for directional movement
- The Collectible class for coins and crystals
- And the Particle class for visual effects

I used Pygame for rendering, collision detection, and event handling. The 
bullet trajectories use sine and cosine functions from Python's math module 
to calculate velocity based on angle.

For the WEBSITE component, I created a Flask application with five routes:
- The index route for the home page
- About, Developer, and Contact pages
- And a newsletter route that handles POST requests

The frontend uses Jinja2 template inheritance - I have a base layout.html with 
the header and footer, and all other pages extend from it. This keeps my code 
DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.

I styled everything with custom CSS using CSS variables for consistent theming, 
and integrated Bootstrap 5 for responsive components like the carousel and forms.

The newsletter system uses SQLite with the CS50 SQL library. When someone 
subscribes, I check if their email already exists to prevent duplicates, then 
insert it into the database.

I also used PyInstaller to compile the game into a standalone executable that 
can run on Windows and Linux without requiring Python to be installed."

================================================================================
SECTION 5: CHALLENGES & LEARNING (45-60 seconds)
================================================================================

[BACK TO: Camera OR slides]

"Throughout this project, I faced several interesting challenges.

One of the biggest was implementing the collision detection between bullets and 
enemies. I had to carefully manage lists and remove objects during iteration, 
which can cause errors if not done correctly. I solved this by iterating over 
copies of the lists.

Another challenge was the particle system. I wanted smooth, natural-looking 
explosions, so I implemented a system where each particle has random velocity, 
gradually shrinks, and fades over time.

For the website, implementing the newsletter system taught me about database 
operations, form validation, and user feedback with flash messages.

I also learned about responsive web design - making sure the website looks good 
on all screen sizes using media queries and flexbox.

This project really pushed me to combine multiple technologies and concepts from 
CS50: object-oriented programming, web development, databases, algorithms, and 
user interface design."

================================================================================
SECTION 6: CONCLUSION (30-45 seconds)
================================================================================

[SHOW: Project running OR back to camera]

"In conclusion, UNLIMITE SHOOTER demonstrates my understanding of:
- Python programming and object-oriented design
- Game development with Pygame
- Web development with Flask
- Frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
- Database operations with SQL
- And software engineering principles like code organization and user experience

This project represents everything I've learned in CS50, and I'm proud of what 
I've created.

Thank you for watching, and...

[SMILE]

...this was CS50!"
